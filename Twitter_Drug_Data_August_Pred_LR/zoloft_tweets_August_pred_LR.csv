2	1299739596385742848	That’s Adderall mixed with Namenda and Zoloft along with a diuretic. Messes with balance, depth perception.	3
3	1299522173992919040	Dude I stopped using Walgreens a few years ago because I repeatedly had my doctors sending things and they failed to fill. They made me late on my birth control and Zoloft countless times. They suck	3
4	1299430677121830912	it’s probably just the zoloft and plastic surgery actin up:woozy face:	3

6	1299356904821407744	She really has to up her Zoloft Rx. Is she this angry all the time? How would you like to be set up on a date with this babe?	3
7	1299216234228178945	 FDA You have to allow up to 300mg of Zoloft You are screwing up my treatment with my nurse practitioner. Honestly you’re wrong you didn’t go far enough 200mg is safe but not effective &amp; it is safer to be effective &amp; safe at 300 who are you kidding?	3
8	1299150021074522113	idk what gets me hotter... you or Zoloft	3
9	1299135975730405378	This is me after I take my Zoloft. Carefree, drifting on my unicorn float, 4 miles away from home	3

15	1298661160200241153	2/2 anxiety level through the roof..my zoloft can't get here (if it ever does) fast enough. It's all I can do to pull it together &amp; go merchandise.	2
16	1298388603513446402	bitch said “i love zoloft :face savoring food: i take it everyday” :face with raised eyebrow:	3

18	1298102565293428739	Yeeears ago I was on Zoloft and it dilated my eyes and a guy asked me if I was high! :face with tears of joy::face with tears of joy::face with tears of joy: I was like OMGaw!! :flushed face::flushed face::flushed face::face with tears of joy::face with tears of joy::face with tears of joy: TotallyClueless	3
19	1298100035654168576	I was on Zoloft before but not the other. Zoloft made my depression so much worse and I lost so much weight from not eating. I hope it works better for you though! It effects everyone differently.	1
20	1298099490532990978	Checks mail...no pills. Thanks, pharmacist . At least I figured out a decent formula of homeopathic pills to get me by. If only my brother or niece were on zoloft, but no...need a cardboard cutout of something I can punch...	2

23	1297910460646338564	I got depression every ten years probably due to Auditory Processing Disorder &amp; Rejection Sensitivity Disorder &amp; PTSD maybe but every ten years since I was 20 I never knew that’s what it was G-Forces of impossible weight suddenly now Zoloft 200mg treats me &amp; I’m treated 4 RSD:smiling face with halo::yawning face:	3
24	1297904713573306372	I’m in awe at all of the support from other mamas!! I’m afraid that antidepressants are just not the thing for me ( I have taken Prozac and Zoloft Wellbutrin and Lexapro and Pristiq in the past) considering I’m used to my Vyvanse... we will see:pleading face:	3
25	1297886566132658176	Zoloft made me have a freak out episode thinking everyone was trying to take my baby and I scream-cried for about 2 hours straight... I haven’t taken it since :loudly crying face: maybe wellbutrin for me??	3
26	1297699166609711105	It’s called Zoloft.	3

30	1297353079000633350	Wait..zoloft makes you not want to be sexually active? Does that mean I might not actually be asexual? Are my meds just genital-blocking me? I need answers.	2
31	1297322794762547207	 Brothers did Tony use Zoloft's algorithm to find Peter for Captain America: Civil War?	3
32	1296876700333031424	get offffff that shit lmao zoloft is not the one i promise you	3
33	1296860214705238016	*me being on high dosages of Zoloft for the past 9 years of my life and never knowing what having a WAP is like*	1
34	1296852206964994048	girls sing WAP like they’re not on 200 mg of zoloft	3
35	1296844216073695232	don’t get me wrong, medication can be a part of a balanced mental health treatment plan, and I still take Zoloft and lamictal, but it’s important to advocate for yourself and find the right provider who believes you and respects your goals. MentalHealthMatters	3
36	1296796208594395141	 wunderful I should probs hide my Zoloft :zany face:	3

43	1296150966509514752	I’m not on Zoloft anymore but I was for a long time! What dosage are you taking? They’ll usually start you on the lowest to make sure you can handle it:sparkling heart:	1
44	1296147078842916865	Me and Zoloft Get Along Just Fine :white heart:	3
45	1296140273605586944	I finally figured out that it’s not my Zoloft it’s my Intuniv 6mg that is making me tired I’ll move it two hours each day towards bed time oh my god without it is bad plus my mom beat me up in words recently &amp; I was fine due to it so that’s that anyway bed time for me Damn Yo Yo	3
46	1296132087813152769	Uneasy Hearts Weigh The Most w/ Me and Zoloft Get Along Just Fine as a close second	3

51	1295570338605142016	this ones for you you raggedy bitch	3
52	1295436751771762689	After taking my Zoloft again for 3 months I just found out I wasn’t even supposed to be on it :grinning face with sweat: so now that I’m off of it again people can tell that there’s been a good change with how I’ve been acting and feeling	3
53	1295435284587347969	That actually made me want to cry. thefeelingisthesame zoloft notears ittakesalot	2
54	1295170487488782338	I upped my Zoloft dosage the other day from 10mg to 20mg and I@ extremely fucked up rn.	3
55	1295060814643318790	I do have MDD also like every ten years but I’m never going off Zoloft but I would have killed myself getting over Effexor but I have both he said it was either or dysthymia or ADD I knew I had ADD &amp; that I was depressed then I grinned once depressed yeah normal Grandma but yeah.	3
56	1294705031468462080	zoloft makes me have the weirdest dreams ever :woozy face:	1
57	1294632515114852353	 kehres She wants specific zoloft receptors. Though her CBD oil doesn't use the receptors she is talking about either. :grinning face with sweat:	3
58	1294435008858423296	DefundThePolice I am now totally on board with this I now understand &amp; getting to admit that I was wrong on this is like I’m on a lot of Zoloft like fat farms &amp; corn flakes I’m not interested right now &amp; still this is like receive the gift of an orgasm in the mail from Madonna&lt;3	3
59	1294320340324188166	    I'm also very sorry to hear that you saw your friend get murdered I think it was only right to put it on it's own tweet reply ... so do you take medicine for your ptsd/trauma like cyriquil or the off brand version I know I'm suppose to be on Zoloft anxiety/depression and cyriquil	3
60	1294083751211708417	For all the personal advocacy I do re: the benefits of Zoloft, I really should get added as a line-item in ’s marketing budget.	3
61	1294062156380614656	quit taking Zoloft and now I nut instantly	3
62	1293789376833413121	Jessica, that’s why I’m on Zoloft	3
63	1293762873890668546	Zoloft wasy main medication for ages but I was also on it for ages. Sadly, like all of them, it didn't last. Thanks Capt.	3
64	1293737238237523968	as far as all the anti-depressants go its not the worst but if you've got latent bipolar disorder zoloft is gonna bring it out screaming.	2
65	1293699357640757248	Prozac, Abilify, Zoloft.. take your pick :smiling face with halo:	3
66	1293671701465698305	Yeah she gets real goofy without her Zoloft	3
67	1293313196762075136	Precisely. How can such a dx be taken seriously when that crap gets rolled out? (Not saying candida isn’t real, but treating it does not address underlying disease). My GP dxed me based on a CBC, CMP, TSH (all “normal”) and gave me script for Zoloft and told me to wait 20 yrs WTF	3
68	1293270559632105473	 ugh oh no zoloft is awful but look into lexapro it definitely made a noticeable difference in my anxiety	3
69	1293268127908802561	 ugh zoloft did that to me but i’ve been on lexapro for like 4 years now and it has made all the difference	1
70	1293267572943736839	I just want to have a big emotional cry but zoloft says ~*~ 𝓝𝓸 ~*~	3
71	1293223792513363968	One of my best friends is on Zoloft and raves about it as well! I’m trying Lexapro right now. I’m going to test it out first to see how I like it!	3
72	1293188677003223043	Yeah, I’ve got that same problem...I take Zoloft for anxiety, and that helps, and then when it’s really bad, I’ll take some Melitonin to help. I find exercise also helps a lot	3
73	1293086882268696576	I take 150mg of Wellbutrin and 200mg of Zoloft daily so I guess I’d have drugs on board too. Oh, also, if I really feel a mentally and physically debilitating anxiety attack coming on I take 1mg Xanax. xx Christine BelowDeckMed	2
74	1293016517630726145	yea it’s prescription zoloft	3
75	1292905466171813888	the immediate rush of seratonin i feel when i see people bought stuff off our registry could easily replace my zoloft prescription	3
76	1292869662712242180	Forreal lmfao like a bitch takes Zoloft once and claims she can speak for the whole schizophrenic community:nauseated face::nauseated face::nauseated face:	3
77	1292517452593672198	My Zoloft dreams had me on a hamster wheel the other night while a bunch of weird people in lab coats were monitoring me through glass.	3
78	1292427182720065536	“Well, you see... New Zoloft is often left off MAPS. When you get put on more maps, you get more cases, you see...Not alot of people know that. If we weren’t on so many MAPS, we would show less cases? And of course new Zoloft isn’t showing cases, there the Hawaii of the austinia”	3
79	1291911975774179331	“you changed fr” yeah I’m on Zoloft now	3
80	1291884041852125184	lol i have been off my Zoloft for quite some time now. the lol is cryptic for “help me” :woozy face::zany face:	2
81	1291855238778028033	Zoloft should pay me to do their PR bc being on it is literally all that I talk about	3
82	1291849663511957504	comedically oversized sandwich and zoloft	3
83	1291548402912763904	  Gyms arent essential to you but they sure as hell are to me. I'd rather stay sober by lifting than picking up a bottle. I'd rather improve my mood with lifting than taking Xanax or Zoloft. These essential businesses ignore guidelines and yet get to stay open	3
84	1291505653899558913	Flyers giving me that extra lift that my Zoloft is lacking	3
85	1291448325711986693	SNRI, not SSNI - sorry about the typo. But also to add that no Zoloft didn’t work for me but it does work for many so if it keeps people alive, then the side effects are more than worth it. These meds can be trial and error!	3
86	1291439391601295361	Also taking one pill isn’t a fair way to judge a medication and decide its quality. Zoloft takes about 3 weeks to even work up in your system and the first few weeks can be full of side effects for some until you adjust to the med. Same with other SSRIs and SSNIs.	1
87	1291158384763457539	Finally talked to a doc about the anxiety I’ve been having and trying out Zoloft for a couple weeks to see if it helps	1
88	1290963761013104641	Damn girl are you the side effects for Zoloft? Because you make me want to contact my physician about what what treatment options are right for me :hugging face: Wow my drafts are the best :face with tears of joy:	3
89	1290822836152459264	I stopped taking my Zoloft cuz I felt like I wasn’t crazy anymore Needless to say, I’m back on it now. :face with tears of joy::unamused face:	3
90	1290698093910986754	Just call me Zoloft	3
91	1290451436363493376	---ZOLOFT--- Turning existential dread into dong and jizz jokes one pill at a time. :pill::hot dog::rolling on the floor laughing:	3
92	1290267005635846145	Go to Zoloft	3
93	1290124778116755458	Antidepressants (and antipsychotics) really are bull shit. Not only do you get to feel nothing, you get fat too. So I'm just short fat and numb ... ahhh this is the life ...now gimme all my Zoloft calories	2
94	1289799177103278080	how is my dr gonna fucking put me on lithium, adderall, hydroxyzine, seroquel, AND zoloft yet still not give me a benzo script. Like damn, woman	3
95	1289753905975275520	"UNfairly chaotic. So has mine. ""Probably"" isn't good enough. Zoloft and Wellbutrin are very good for handling depression and anxiety."	3
96	1289467933043777536	Zoloft fucking sucks	3
97	1289388133495103490	Started taking my Zoloft with a shot of whiskey is that bad	1
