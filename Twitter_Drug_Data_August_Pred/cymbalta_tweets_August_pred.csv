3	1299010030314889218	To elaborate: my brain doesn’t produce natural highs, and without the highs produced by THC, I have constant mental lows. So I take it before bed. I’m not behind the wheel smoking dope - that’s silly, dangerous, and UNPROFESSIONAL. Cymbalta &amp; CBD don’t work alone.	0

I also started Cymbalta for pain last week. And soon Lupron injections to shrink fibroids. I'm tired.	0
