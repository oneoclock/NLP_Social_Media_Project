17	1292249028038725632	Thank you!!! I am very happy. It was extremely exhausting and I gave up a ton of times but I’m SO glad I gave it another shot. SSRI’s didn’t work for me and Wellbutrin gave me awful side effects. My friend recommended Effexor and I took the dive!!! It’s working so well already.	0
