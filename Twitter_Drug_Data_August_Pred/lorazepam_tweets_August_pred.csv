Not to mention my waking hours have been all jittery/ panicky. I took a lorazepam, cuz I fucking need it. I’m watching	0

2	1299565161653702658	Love my clonazepam &amp; lorazepam	1
3	1299521493727088640	Girl, me too! I'm *supposed to* take Buspar, Seroquel, Lorazepam, &amp; Ambien min. I just quit Buspar 2 weeks ago. I may try quitting Seroquel (slowly)... But sadly, I've been on Lorazepam too long to quit without seizures. So I'm working on it slowly.	0
4	1297657926342107142	Here is a Plasma Drug Concentration for two anti anxiety medications Triozolam and Lorazepam. As you can see the fast acting drug would not be in the therapeutic range for a long period of time resulting as a short acting benzodiazepine.	2
5	1293023857767591936	" Got banned Yep. I'm more an ""all day stress"" bc I have OCD - anxiety is co-morbid. People w/ anxiety attacks may do better w/ Xanax. Both &amp; have discussed this openly, otherwise I'd never tag them otherwise. Lorazepam is a good starter for those unsure of where to start"	2
6	1293022363404120064	" Got banned Valium IS bullshit. I have to take Lorazepam now 4 life bc I had the dreaded ""3 seizures"" and the 4th means I have to take it by law to drive. But I've been taking it since I was 23 (soon 40) anyway. But my sis has grand-mal seizures, too. So you get it. It does double-duty. :disappointed face:"	0
7	1293021071315218433	" Got banned See that? Lorazepam &amp; Xanax are the two best for anxiety. One hits harder, fast (Xanax) - the other is good for an ""all day stress"" (Lorazepam). Def ask about both. :growing heart:"	2
8	1293020670033616900	" Got banned I take 6mg Lorazepam. I see how you roll. I keep telling that one of these 2 meds will help a lot. Xanax was a little too ""immediate"" for me. Lorazepam was better for ""all day kinds of crazy"". Depends on type of anxiety:red heart: Valium = useless. For anyone needing real help. :hundred points:"	2
9	1292863739809669120	Lorazepam is good for anxiety	2
10	1291705057164107777	That’s like me too. I take lorazepam and use CBD, which does help.	0
11	1291540497144700929	"Wait til you get that Lorazepam! I go through Netflix and it says I watched an entire season of something...and I'm like ""what?? I didn't watch this!"" :grinning squinting face: It's like 12 episodes everytime, too! :hundred points:"	2
12	1291429953561661444	I don’t understand how lorazepam is supposed to help with seizures and anxiety but also make you suicidal.. wtf type of side affect is that.. “you won’t have seizures and anxiety anymore but you might wanna kill yourself”	2
13	1291137049467195392	I do, too. So I wait til the Lorazepam kicks in and then just start saying things.	0
