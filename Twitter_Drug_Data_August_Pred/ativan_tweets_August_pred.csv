Had his IV not been infiltrated and they had really be giving Ativan he would’ve left them alone. Dude been sleep on me since 10pm :raising hands medium-dark skin tone::raising hands medium-dark skin tone:	2

2	1299394323184668672	Got two things to say and it has nothing to do with far right garbage humans. 1) final round of chemo starts now! 2) IV Ativan is a solid choice	1
3	1299037359682420736	I think I need an Ativan. Damn, it’s early too.	1

5	1298742154450399235	My last two tweets might lead some of youse to feel like sleuths and think “they’re definitely doing blow right now.” You’d be wrong. I’m off Ativan and dilaudid	2

10	1298085471634042886	Nana asked if I needed an Ativan and I said “no” but I was lying	1
11	1298047362980622336	According to the boating and flight industry there are very different rules If i was taking Ativan I can tell you I would be void of any emotions. Anxiety meds effect everyone differently	2
12	1297607930376749056	Benadryl, Ativan, and Haldol all at once.	1
13	1297545431656943616	Good to know! I need some doggy Ativan for Odie	1
14	1297448503577214976	I’ve been on both. Yes, Ativan is highly addictive and harder to stop using. Personally, I felt way better/safer being on Trazadone. I was on ~25 mg and did not wake up drowsy or in a haze at alll like I would when I took Ativan. Hope this helps momma :two hearts:	0
15	1297417627007098881	Same. I’m all panicky and shit. Already walked around outside and inside. Checked in the ferret. Took an Ativan. I hate this shit.	0

23	1294489604524040192	Just realized this is a picture post Ativan with tears, not the nice photo where I’m cozy post wiped/dried tears. Horray for transparency, I’ve hid in forced positivity too many times. Make struggles less taboo. Mental health is always a battle we sometimes lose. We try.	2
24	1294229240494395393	Took an Ativan for my anxiety last night and than ran an hour on my treadmill. Got off and ate a bunch of chocolate ice cream &amp; birthday cake Oreos. Smoked my juul for a while and then crashed. Didn’t drink! Always a work in progress. fridaymorning	0

28	1293830828821295106	some type of wishes or prayers for me would be grately appreciated. all i got to say is the ativan is fucking strong :woozy face::rolling on the floor laughing: thanks to the workers who are being nice and sorry to my wallet for the next 6 months going to this bill :upside-down face:	1
29	1293414914854236160	Fuck that wasn't Ativan	2
30	1293385058644983811	Me too! Except every once in a while I hear his tweets in Morgan Freeman’s voice and that’s more soothing than Ativan	2
31	1293263020395761664	Just because you want ativan doesn't mean I am going to give it to you	2
32	1293244869540945920	Today’s to-do list: 1. Wear a mask because pandemic. 2. Do the work because BlackLivesMatter &amp; Breonna Taylor’s murderers still haven’t been arrested &amp; 45 is still the “president”. 3. Find leftover Ativan from dentist appt because the game will have a 3rd qtr.	2

36	1292269295511072768	Feeling myself get hot from the inside out was one of the more unpleasant parts of the experience. But I had music and a sleep mask and 0.5 mg ativan.

37	1291890953519869953	Had to take my Ativan for the first time ever so you could say my weekend is starting out amazing	0
38	1291505169415327744	"Ativan is an appropriate long term treatment protocol for the disgusting sick torture I endure every single day--we will not be moving to a world where we prescribe Benadryl and visteril for ""organized re-murder"" and systemic lack of privacy bypaa"	2
39	1291392989516959744	Going to cath lab this afternoon. Trying to not freak out about all the worst case scenarios. I have a dye allergy so I have to get steroids &amp; Benadryl. Talked with the doc and got in the van....the ativan so I’m feeling calmer.	1

41	1291056114260414466	I suffer from insane insomnia. The only thing that works for me so far is... Ativan. Not exactly an every night sort of solution. I only take it when things get critical. I am desperate for other solutions, though :(	1
42	1290985767699980290	Shut up and take your Ativan	2
43	1290884509307678721	I wish y’all could hear this man screaming down this hallway. His vocal chords should be tired ..... he’s been doing this all night .... he needs Haldol and Ativan immediately.	2
44	1290802781725569025	 to eye the narcotic drugs like Ativan, klonopin, &amp; Valium are. SSRIs for anxiety, like Wellbutrin &amp; Celexa, are not.	2
45	1290444559718195203	Damnit. Just as I was slowly working on my ptsd of seeing the video of George Floyd being killed, all of a sudden there is new footage. My psychiatrist put me on Ativan because I was hearing his screams for his mom all day and night for WEEKS. I wasn’t sleeping.	1
