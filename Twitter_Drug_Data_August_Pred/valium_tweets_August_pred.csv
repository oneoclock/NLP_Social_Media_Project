129	1293731782878273536	"can u pls settle a dispute I'm having w/ people attacking U &amp; Malia re: Hannah's Valium. Earlier shows we've seen medication in kitchen refer 2 as"" pain"" meds. I always assumed it was over the counter medicine &amp; NOT controlled pain med like hydrocodone. YES OR NO?"	2
130	1293704676844724226	Mother just asked Doctor for valium.	2
131	1293701836914995200	The place I went to has been doing them for years too but I was still freaked to shit. They had to give me a second Valium bc I was panicking so bad :/	1
132	1293700110505979904	If they offer you Valium, take. The. Valium. Get the artificial tears if they offer them. They’re your saving grace. Breathe deep and stare like they tell you. :victory hand::victory hand:	2
133	1293659504911872000	  BS. First of all the CBD is LEGAL in Spain and is commonly used in the treatment of medical conditions including anxiety. Secondly, the Valium dose was an extremely low dose and safe to work on, Furthermore, you don’t know whether Hannah already told sandy re her PRESCRIBED meds.	2
134	1293635382005788672	Hiding under the house is my Valium.	1

136	1293587217932259329	You made a general statement Valium comes in bubble packs only and that is not True.	2
137	1293586700090986496	"even though they fall under the same classification does not mean they share exactly the same pitfalls. Valium first is not even close to the properties of narcotics. It isn't prudent to compare one ""benzo"" to all others &amp; each person reacts differently. Sandy was still aware."	2
138	1293559597043785728	Amusingly, my SN comes not from weather, but from being 2mi from the Northridge Earthquake. I heard it coming, seconds before it hit, and it sounded like, well, distant thunder. I can sleep thru a storm overhead (like most south Floridians), but distant, I need Valium.	1
139	1293396399959216130	And to be clear marijuana is not cocaine! Lol and 5mg of Valium ain’t enough to knock out a small dog. Do your research. Also, we’ve seen cap sandy mentor drunks but let mental health fall at the waist side.. there’s a HUGE PROB here! Let’s be real!	2
140	1293385420861067266	  Also I would think someone abusing Valium would try to hide it and not keep their Valium in a box marked VALIUM	2
141	1293373497893240832	They are not fun &amp; kinda scary . You can’t get rid of it :((. Valium helps . But I can’t imagine the girl seeing Hannah so upset and then taking a picture of her stuff and sending it what a witch	2
142	1293368685696937984	Whatever , even on the below deck series Capt Lee did it different, the previous Season with Sandy she knew about the Hannah’s Valium	2
143	1293362774735716353	Now granted, Malia is probably still a snitch, but it wasn’t about the anxiety meds and the Valium, it was about the weed.	2
144	1293360938758922246	Saw BelowDeckMed trending last night for Malia snitching on Hannah about anxiety meds... Y’all are suckers who fell for a good tease. It wasn’t about the Valium and anxiety... It was the weed vape in the photo. Can’t be having that from country to country on a yacht.	2
145	1293347679272144897	What’s the big deal? I take Valium just to watch the show.  	1

147	1293341534545301505	All you hoes need to watch back the season. We’ve heard Valium come out of   mouth at least two previous times. There are maritime laws and Hannah defied based on what we saw. We won’t know outcome until next week. For the record ihatehannah	2
148	1293331135301332992	Read about Valium. Is a level 5 drug meaning widely prescribed for anxiety with almost no abuse. Sandy knew she was on Valium from last season and she only had to have another crew member dispense. Actually that's quite ridiculous and radical as anxiety is a very personal thing.	2
149	1293313443345268737	  I just don't think she should have kept valium and CBD a secret from captain Sandy :woman shrugging:	2
150	1293299919923617793	Valium, widly used level V classification meaning minimal chance of misuse.The only thing is if Sandy is telling the truth about not knowing&amp; dispensing wasn't done by another crew member.Sandi was aware of Hannah's meds earlier.Malia is vindictive &amp; wants her way at all cost	2
151	1293275256417914881	I had voiced my concern to my doctor and got a prescription for valium just in case. I cried	1
152	1293249989003677696	  .5mg too..short half-life too.. this is NOT like taking klonopin or xanax. Valium is on the bottom of the benzo-scale. She took a tik-tak in medicine form.	2
153	1293217743546667008	  Why didn't she just disclose the Valium and CBD prior to charter? None of this would be happening if Hannah had been honest about needing meds to help her through panic attacks. Malia knew this, and used it against Hannah. That's the tragedy here. Malia.	2

155	1293216640637706240	  No, I meant that Hannah was assumably on birth control as well as; cbd, Valium, nicotine, alcohol, advil pm and whatever else. My point is she mixed benzos with other medications. Moreover, she didn't disclose the Valium or CBD prior to charter. Why not just be honest?	2
