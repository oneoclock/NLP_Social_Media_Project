7	1299216234228178945	 FDA You have to allow up to 300mg of Zoloft You are screwing up my treatment with my nurse practitioner. Honestly you’re wrong you didn’t go far enough 200mg is safe but not effective &amp; it is safer to be effective &amp; safe at 300 who are you kidding?	2

35	1296844216073695232	don’t get me wrong, medication can be a part of a balanced mental health treatment plan, and I still take Zoloft and lamictal, but it’s important to advocate for yourself and find the right provider who believes you and respects your goals. MentalHealthMatters	0

62	1293789376833413121	Jessica, that’s why I’m on Zoloft	1
63	1293762873890668546	Zoloft wasy main medication for ages but I was also on it for ages. Sadly, like all of them, it didn't last. Thanks Capt.	0
64	1293737238237523968	as far as all the anti-depressants go its not the worst but if you've got latent bipolar disorder zoloft is gonna bring it out screaming.	2
65	1293699357640757248	Prozac, Abilify, Zoloft.. take your pick :smiling face with halo:	2
66	1293671701465698305	Yeah she gets real goofy without her Zoloft	2
67	1293313196762075136	Precisely. How can such a dx be taken seriously when that crap gets rolled out? (Not saying candida isn’t real, but treating it does not address underlying disease). My GP dxed me based on a CBC, CMP, TSH (all “normal”) and gave me script for Zoloft and told me to wait 20 yrs WTF	2
68	1293270559632105473	 ugh oh no zoloft is awful but look into lexapro it definitely made a noticeable difference in my anxiety	1
69	1293268127908802561	 ugh zoloft did that to me but i’ve been on lexapro for like 4 years now and it has made all the difference	0
70	1293267572943736839	I just want to have a big emotional cry but zoloft says ~*~ 𝓝𝓸 ~*~	1
71	1293223792513363968	One of my best friends is on Zoloft and raves about it as well! I’m trying Lexapro right now. I’m going to test it out first to see how I like it!	2
72	1293188677003223043	Yeah, I’ve got that same problem...I take Zoloft for anxiety, and that helps, and then when it’s really bad, I’ll take some Melitonin to help. I find exercise also helps a lot	0
73	1293086882268696576	I take 150mg of Wellbutrin and 200mg of Zoloft daily so I guess I’d have drugs on board too. Oh, also, if I really feel a mentally and physically debilitating anxiety attack coming on I take 1mg Xanax. xx Christine BelowDeckMed	0
74	1293016517630726145	yea it’s prescription zoloft	2
75	1292905466171813888	the immediate rush of seratonin i feel when i see people bought stuff off our registry could easily replace my zoloft prescription	1

79	1291911975774179331	“you changed fr” yeah I’m on Zoloft now	0
80	1291884041852125184	lol i have been off my Zoloft for quite some time now. the lol is cryptic for “help me” :woozy face::zany face:	0
81	1291855238778028033	Zoloft should pay me to do their PR bc being on it is literally all that I talk about	2
82	1291849663511957504	comedically oversized sandwich and zoloft	2
83	1291548402912763904	  Gyms arent essential to you but they sure as hell are to me. I'd rather stay sober by lifting than picking up a bottle. I'd rather improve my mood with lifting than taking Xanax or Zoloft. These essential businesses ignore guidelines and yet get to stay open	2
84	1291505653899558913	Flyers giving me that extra lift that my Zoloft is lacking	1
85	1291448325711986693	SNRI, not SSNI - sorry about the typo. But also to add that no Zoloft didn’t work for me but it does work for many so if it keeps people alive, then the side effects are more than worth it. These meds can be trial and error!	2
86	1291439391601295361	Also taking one pill isn’t a fair way to judge a medication and decide its quality. Zoloft takes about 3 weeks to even work up in your system and the first few weeks can be full of side effects for some until you adjust to the med. Same with other SSRIs and SSNIs.	2
87	1291158384763457539	Finally talked to a doc about the anxiety I’ve been having and trying out Zoloft for a couple weeks to see if it helps	0
88	1290963761013104641	Damn girl are you the side effects for Zoloft? Because you make me want to contact my physician about what what treatment options are right for me :hugging face: Wow my drafts are the best :face with tears of joy:	2
89	1290822836152459264	I stopped taking my Zoloft cuz I felt like I wasn’t crazy anymore Needless to say, I’m back on it now. :face with tears of joy::unamused face:	0
90	1290698093910986754	Just call me Zoloft	1
91	1290451436363493376	---ZOLOFT--- Turning existential dread into dong and jizz jokes one pill at a time. :pill::hot dog::rolling on the floor laughing:	2
92	1290267005635846145	Go to Zoloft	1
93	1290124778116755458	Antidepressants (and antipsychotics) really are bull shit. Not only do you get to feel nothing, you get fat too. So I'm just short fat and numb ... ahhh this is the life ...now gimme all my Zoloft calories	1
94	1289799177103278080	how is my dr gonna fucking put me on lithium, adderall, hydroxyzine, seroquel, AND zoloft yet still not give me a benzo script. Like damn, woman	1
95	1289753905975275520	"UNfairly chaotic. So has mine. ""Probably"" isn't good enough. Zoloft and Wellbutrin are very good for handling depression and anxiety."	1
96	1289467933043777536	Zoloft fucking sucks	1
