64	1293637629867700224	 prozac   I get you, sis! Push back! But this is truly a historic and revolutionary moment for black women, and I think we would be remiss to miss it by talking about mistakes make a decade ago.

66	1293632806397108224	   prozac I agree that when you look at her record, there are laws and decisions she was tied too that were harmful to black people. However, Sen. Harris does not carry the justice system on her back, ya know? I def get what you’re saying, I just think that the analysis isn’t entirely fair	2
67	1293629790508003328	   prozac Personally, I wanted the nominee to be Stacy Abrams. However, the crucifixion of Sen. Harris is truly uncalled for. Any career prosecutor has significant mistakes.

71	1293384371714629632	 prozac Talk about it. EXPECALLY our black women. Folk are pro-black “rooting for everyone whose black.” Until it’s time for a black woman with an imperfect record to take the stand... now we’re throwing tomatoes?	2

73	1292952666885230592	Look at Trump, he said “Senator Schumer” rather than “Cryin’ Chuck”. Someone must have snuck some Prozac in his Big Mac. :rolling on the floor laughing:	2
74	1292871980782432257	This is what happens when they get off their Prozac and the liberals close almost all the mental hospitals.	2

77	1292497480605630466	 wonderer this is an example of how the original AD commercials were marketed in the US Theres some documentary, I can’t remember explaining how the “Prozac era” influenced these commercials Theres pros/cons that are argued over the “Prozac era” and AD commercials	2
78	1292266022150516736	I guess I was kind of writing sports off when it came back, maybe because I haven’t been taking my Prozac and what not, but I’m actually feeling excited and emotional about sports again, I love it	0
79	1292130167100452864	Actually, I think it IS the French horn. It's been so long. I used to listen to those symphonies over and over. Beethoven was my Prozac. The music lifted me from my North American Protestant neighborhood onto a vast epic metaphysical plane.	2

87	1291130164882153474	 40mg  em Never said that there wasn’t any outside influences at all. In fact his biggest fans/influences were his children actually. He began telling/writing his stories for them &amp;it was yrs before they were published. My point was he didn’t have a whole fan base helping craft the mythos.	2
88	1290821024511143937	Talking into the void now: I've been on Prozac for depression off and on for three years. I am currently off, my last dose taken sometime mid-April as I was feeling better. Just within the past week or so, I've been feeling sort of like shit again. It's a big WTF-Do-I-Do sandwich	0
