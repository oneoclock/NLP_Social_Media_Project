6	1198151060516458498	 blazin What meds do you take? Anything? I know it sounds minor but Epsom salts in my bath help me. I feel your pain. If you can get moving (I know it hurts) but it helps me more than if I lay or sit. Cymbalta made it worse. I got very depressed too. Hope it gets better.	2

8	1197646614250360832	most of the side effects of my cymbalta are bearable if i take it right before bed :index pointing up: so i think this is a good medication	0
9	1197620504120705024	I ended up taking cymbalta and it got rid of the flare ups I used to get a lot from my fibro but I also had to take it cause I was so depressed of being dismissed of my pain and just told cause I gain a lot of weight it was my fault (which didn't happen until I started depo)	0

11	1196966929174581248	 stevens Yes. Cymbalta did that for me as of the lightheaded and dizziness. And to date I have not had a single SSRI work for the whole time I was on it - even after upping the dose :/	0

13	1196269829889511424	seriously considering tapering myself off my generic Cymbalta as I happen to have both 60 mg and 30 mg capsules only because my doctor UPPED my dosage which caused all this in the first place	1
14	1196202210926960641	My psychiatrist prescribed me generic Cymbalta. I’m not sure I should be on it or if it’s helping or making things worse but I seem to not have an appetite and if my scale is right I’ve lost 10 lbs. so maybe it’s not a bad thing?	1
15	1195465368564883458	I'm the life of the party everywhere I go. Finally got my doctor back that started wee ing me off cymbalta!! WOOOO!!!! No more red tape baby! She wants to make sure I'm behaving.

16	1195052542465458177	It has been better the last couple weeks since lowering my cymbalta and upping my Wellbutrin but for a solid few months there I would have crying fits like 5 times a day every single day It was exhausting	0
17	1194766679265468416	y’all people are like “I blacked out after two drinks because of Cymbalta” and honestly SAME SAME SAME	2
18	1192208325447843840	 Atheist I was prescribed Cymbalta and could not stand it for a week. Felt semi comatose. I would rather be achy with the fibromyalgia and awake to deal with depression.	1
19	1191944066767953926	Someone said my poetry is too depressing. Make me happy and I’ll write a happy one. Until then, my Cymbalta is my muse	1
20	1191774079608594435	Maybe what you are taking them for. I am on Cymbalta for serious anxiety and depression. Works great. Plenty of my patients report the same. No med works for everyone of course and all have potential side effects. Right patient, right dose, right patient is my motto.	0
21	1191553505053548544	 Chips Like almost all SSRI, you’ll take longer for practical sexual functioning. I started Lexapro’s older SSRI brother, Cymbalta, just this past Spring	2
22	1191402281775910912	He also is the first rheum to not tell me I was lying when I said cymbalta caused extremely high BP. So were considering Lyrica now. I’m also getting tested for a connective tissue disease?	2
